# Course: Python for Eveybody - Trial
## What I learned today
### Computer Architecture Basics

- *CPU (Central Processing Unit):* the "brain" of the computer, executes instructions.  
- *Main Memory (RAM):* short-term working space, stores programs and data while running. Contents disappear when power is off.  
- *Secondary Memory (Disk/SSD):* long-term storage for programs and files, data stays after shutdown.  

### How they work together
1. A program (like Python code) is saved on *secondary memory*.  
2. When executed, it is loaded into *main memory (RAM)*.  
3. The *CPU* reads instructions from RAM and performs them step by step.  

### Python's role
- Python is a tool (programming language) used by programmers to tell the computer what to do.  
- It connects the "back side" (logic, code, processing) with the "front side" (what users see and use).  

### Analogy
- *Secondary memory = bookshelf*  
- *Main memory = desk*  
- *CPU = your brain*  
- *Python = the language of the books with instructions*

### Reserved Words
So if we start at vocabulary, the first thing we have in every programming language is what's called reserved words. Now, what do we mean by reserved words? Well, these are words that if we use these words, we must use them to mean the thing that Python expects them to mean. Another way to put that is we can't use them elsewhere. We can't make up a variable named import. We can't make a variable named assert; because if Python sees assert, it means something very specific to Python.Reserved Words in Python

In every programming language, we have whatâ€™s called reserved words (or keywords).
These are special words that have a specific meaning in Python and cannot be used for other purposes, such as naming variables.

If we use these words, we must use them in the way Python expects.

We cannot make up a variable named import or assert.

If Python sees assert, it knows it is a command with special meaning, not just a name.
