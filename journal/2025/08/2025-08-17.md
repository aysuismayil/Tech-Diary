# Course: Python for Eveybody - Trial
### What I learned today
# Computer Architecture Basics

- *CPU (Central Processing Unit):* the "brain" of the computer, executes instructions.  
- *Main Memory (RAM):* short-term working space, stores programs and data while running. Contents disappear when power is off.  
- *Secondary Memory (Disk/SSD):* long-term storage for programs and files, data stays after shutdown.  

### How they work together
1. A program (like Python code) is saved on *secondary memory*.  
2. When executed, it is loaded into *main memory (RAM)*.  
3. The *CPU* reads instructions from RAM and performs them step by step.  

### Python's role
- Python is a tool (programming language) used by programmers to tell the computer what to do.  
- It connects the "back side" (logic, code, processing) with the "front side" (what users see and use).  

### Analogy
- *Secondary memory = bookshelf*  
- *Main memory = desk*  
- *CPU = your brain*  
- *Python = the language of the books with instructions*
